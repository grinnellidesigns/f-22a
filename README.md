# Grinnelli Designs F-22A Raptor
Welcome! This GitHub repository contains the source code and release versions of the F-22A Raptor community mod by Grinnelli Designs.
If you're here for the Raptor mod, please follow [this link](https://github.com/grinnellidesigns/f-22a/releases/latest) to download it. **Please note that the DCS: F-15C or DCS: Flaming Cliffs 3 expansions are required for this mod to work properly.**

### Important Note
Because the mod relies on the F-15C Avionics, you will need to add `load_immediately = true,` inside of `Mods/aircraft/F-15C/entry.lua`. See [this message on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/778817642860904468/1010337321620623410/1375669978568593419) for details.

## About the Raptor
The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is an American single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United States Air Force. As the result of the USAF’s Advanced Tactical Fighter program, the aircraft was designed as an air superiority fighter, but also has ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence capabilities.

The prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, built most of the F-22’s airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems. The aircraft first flew in 1997 and was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the F-22A.
